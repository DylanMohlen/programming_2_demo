This project contains some basic class examples:

- `Player.cs` shows a simple class with fields, overloaded constructors and use of `this` to call one constructor from another.
- `PlayerPrimary.cs` shows the use of a primary constructor, accessing primary constructor parameters in a method and the need to call the primary constructor from any other constructors that are created.
- `MyMath.cs` show the use of static class methods and fields
